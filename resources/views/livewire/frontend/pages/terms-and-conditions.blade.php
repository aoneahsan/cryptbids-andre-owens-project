                        contact the seller on the buyer’s behalf to ask for the funds to be returned, but we offer no
                        guarantees once the funds have left our escrow.</p>

                        emails. Do not click any links asking you to verify your login details. We would never ask for
                        that. Double check any URL sent to you before clicking on it and make sure it’s not a phishing

                        Headings
                        <br><br>
                        Headings are for reference purposes only and in no way define, limit, construe or describe the
                        scope or extent of such section. Our failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others
                        does not waive our right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches. These terms set
                        forth the entire understanding and agreement between us with respect to the subject matter
                        therein.

                        Final Provisions
                        <br><br>
                        These Terms are governed by the USA law. Use of our website is unauthorized in any jurisdiction
                        that does not give effect to all provisions of these Terms, including, without limitation, this
                        paragraph.
                        <br><br>
                        Our performance of these Terms is subject to existing laws and legal process, and nothing
                        contained in these Terms limits our right to comply with law enforcement or other governmental
                        or legal requests or requirements relating to your use of our Platform or information provided
                        to or gathered by us with respect to such use.
                        <br><br>
                        If any part of these Terms is found to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity,
                        legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions will not in any way be affected or
                        impaired. Our failure or delay in enforcing any provision of these Terms at any time does not
                        waive our right to enforce the same or any other provision(s) hereof in the future.
                        <br><br>
